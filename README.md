# THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY BROKEN

# CrossEnv

This is a cross-platform environment variable editor, it works on Windows and Linux. I don't have a Mac and I don't want to test it on there. 
If you are editing or adding local variables you do not need to root/admin. You will need it if you are editing and adding system-wide variables

# Notes
Local only works on the current run of the app, once it's closed it gets erased

# Requirements
Python 3 and tk

# Download (Release)
Just get the version from the release tab and run it

# Dowmload (Source)
Grab the source
`git clone https://github.com/TheDiamondOG/CrossEnv`

Go into the directory
`cd CrossEnv`

Then run it
`python3 main.py`
